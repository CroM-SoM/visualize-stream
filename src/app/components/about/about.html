    <h4>About the project</h4>
    <p>Crowd Management with Social Media (CroM-SoM), is a collaboration between Amsterdam Data Science, the VU (Vrije Universiteit) and the CWI (Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica). The goal of the project is to use Social Media responses as a tool to "nudge" people from crowded areas towards areas or events off the beaten track.</p>
    <p>In this reaserach project, Tweets from within the city center of Amsterdam are gathered and analyzed. For every user that tweets whitin a certain range we determnie wheither he or she is a tourist. Together with the user information we receive from Twitter we match tourists with events that might be of interest to the user. The events mainly take place outside the city centre. In this way we try to stimulate tourist to go "off the beaten track" by discovering sites and events outside the city of Amsterdam</p>
    <p>The above map is a live visalization of people currently tweeting within our set range. In the section beneith  you can find the steps our algoritms makes to determine wheter someone is a tourist or not and the suggestion we sent to them by an automated twitter response.</p>
