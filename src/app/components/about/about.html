	<h4>About the project</h4>
	<p>Crowd Management with Social Media (CroM-SoM), is a
		collaboration between Amsterdam Data Science, the VU (Vrije
		Universiteit) and the CWI (Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica). The
		goal of the project is to use Social Media responses as a tool to
		"nudge" people from crowded areas towards areas or events off the
		beaten track.</p>
	<p>In this research project, Tweets from within the city center of
		Amsterdam are gathered and analyzed. For every user that tweets within
		a certain range we determine whether he or she is a tourist. Together
		with the user information we receive from Twitter we match tourists
		with events that might be of interest to the user. The events mainly
		take place outside the city centre. In this way we try to stimulate
		tourist to go "off the beaten track" by discovering sites and events
		outside the city of Amsterdam</p>
	<p>The above map is a live visualisation of people currently
		tweeting within our set range. In the section below you can find the
		steps our algorithm makes to determine whether someone is a tourist or
		not and the suggestion we sent to them by an automated twitter
		response.</p>
